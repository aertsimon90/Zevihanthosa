## Current Models and Versions

### Latest Release: ZevihaNut/1.4

ZevihaNut/1.4 is the latest iteration of the Zevihanthosa AI framework, introducing several key enhancements and features to improve its overall performance and versatility:

New Activation Function (bisigmoid): A new bisigmoid activation function has been introduced, which outputs values between -1 and 1. This offers better scalability and adaptability, providing a smoother transition for decision-making processes. The bisigmoid function enhances the model's ability to manage both positive and negative activations with greater precision.

Enhanced Neural Processing System: The Brain module has been further refined, improving weight distribution and dynamic memory handling. The backpropagation mechanism has also been optimized, resulting in faster, more accurate learning and a more stable training process.

Hybrid Vectorization: A combination of grammar-based learning, hash-based vectorization, and adaptive tokenization has been introduced. This hybrid approach ensures more efficient language understanding and context processing. New methods of tokenization have been developed to improve the parsing of text and enhance the model's ability to understand and respond contextually.

Momentum-Based Training: The training process has been further optimized with momentum-driven mechanisms. This improvement ensures smoother learning progression, balancing speed and stability to prevent drastic fluctuations during training.

Multi-Layer Support: The AdvancedChatbot class now supports deeper learning with automatic layer structuring, allowing ZevihaNut/1.4 to tackle more complex tasks. The multi-layer architecture enables the model to make more informed decisions and respond with greater efficiency.

Improved Tokenization Methods: New tokenization techniques have been added to split text in ways that mirror natural human reading patterns. These methods include sentence-based, basic word-based, and directive-based tokenization, ensuring more accurate parsing of text for better understanding and response generation.

Context Manager: A new feature called ContextManager has been introduced, which allows chatbots to handle and track conversational context more effectively. This enables better context switching, improved long-term memory, and more accurate responses.

Automatic Data Saving and Loading: ZevihaNut/1.4 now supports automatic saving and loading of the AI brain's training data. This allows developers to easily save progress and load previously saved models, making the training process more efficient and streamlined.
