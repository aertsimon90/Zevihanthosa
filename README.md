# Zevihanthosa

What is Zevihanthosa?

Zevihanthosa is an advanced artificial intelligence framework developed by aertsimon90. It is designed to provide a flexible, beginner-friendly, and highly efficient AI architecture. Unlike complex frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, Zevihanthosa offers a simplified yet powerful AI development environment, allowing fine-tuned adjustments without unnecessary complexity.

A core feature of Zevihanthosa is its dynamic, weight-based learning process, enhanced by a momentum-driven training mechanism, which improves both learning speed and accuracy. The framework supports custom activation functions, multi-layer architectures, and decision-making strategies, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

With its focus on scalability, usability, and efficiency, Zevihanthosa continues to evolve, integrating cutting-edge improvements with each update.

All chatbot AI models now store input data with language identifiers, allowing multilingual AI development.

The format update ensures seamless integration of multiple languages in chatbot training.



4. Language Detection & Translation

New functions have been introduced to automatically detect input language.

A new GoogleTranslator class allows efficient text translation and language processing for multilingual support.



5. Unicode Standard for AI Models

AI models that rely solely on Unicode character processing are now classified as low-level.

This change encourages the development of more advanced AI systems capable of deep learning and contextual understanding.



6. Enhanced AI Training Stability

Several bug fixes and optimizations have been implemented to enhance training performance and stability.



7. Automatic Data Saving & Loading

AI objects can now automatically save and reload their trained data, making AI training more seamless.



8. Expanded Context Management

Improved ContextManager functionality for handling chatbot conversations more effectively.



9. More User-Friendly Implementation

ZevihaNut/1.5 focuses on ease of use, making Zevihanthosa more beginner-friendly while maintaining advanced features.
