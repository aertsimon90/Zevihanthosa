## ZevihaNut/3.0 Model (Latest Release - January 2026)
*A lightweight, pure-Python hybrid AI framework combining parametric neurons, non-parametric memory, safe symbolic regression, massively scaled localized ensembles, and Deep Multi-Layer Networks — now with significantly improved numerical stability, memory reset control, quantization-aware behavior, hierarchical lobe-based modularity, natural error-driven plasticity, and flexible meta-control over learning & forgetting.*

### Overview
**ZevihaNut/3.0** introduces major advances in stability, plasticity control and hierarchical structure while faithfully preserving the framework’s fundamental philosophy: extreme minimalism, fully online/incremental learning, complete serialization of the entire system, and a deeply hybrid parametric + non-parametric intelligence.

**Main novelties in ZevihaNut/3.0:**

- Introduction of the new **Brain** class — a hierarchical, multi-lobe architecture that allows different modules (lobes) to have distinct roles, learning dynamics, and plasticity profiles while sharing a unified backpropagation pass
- Completely revamped **forget** mechanism:  
  `.forget(force)` now accepts a continuous forget factor (0.0 = full reset, 1.0 = no change, 0.3 = strong but gradual forgetting, etc.)  
  → much finer meta-plasticity control across all cell types and higher structures
- New **learnrate** parameter propagated through the entire system + optional **naturalderiv** mode  
  When activated, updates become proportional to |error| → very strong, biologically-inspired adaptation to large errors
- Per-lobe plasticity modulation via `lobesset`  
  Each lobe can have independent trainrate and learnrate multipliers → allows creating fast-adapting sensory lobes, slow & stable conceptual lobes, conservative decision/output lobes, etc.
- Consistent propagation of new control parameters (`learnrate`, `naturalderiv`, `force`) across **all** levels:  
  single cells → forests → networks → multi-lobe Brain
- Significantly improved numerical and training stability for very deep, very wide or very long-running incremental/online learning scenarios

These changes move Zevihanthosa further toward a more modular, biologically plausible and controllable extreme-specialization system — while keeping the core principles of radical minimalism, full incrementality, complete serialization and hybrid parametric/non-parametric nature fully intact.

**Key Features of ZevihaNut/3.0**

- Pure Python & minimal dependencies (`random`, `math`, `json`, `ast`, `functools`)
- Fully online / incremental learning — true per-sample adaptation with no batch requirement
- Deep hierarchical backpropagation through arbitrary depth and modular structure
- Advanced momentum with exchange control (default 0.9)
- Automatic weight/bias clamping and numerical stability safeguards
- Rich & flexible activation family:  
  sigmoid, softsign, tanh, Swish, positive/negative linear, hard-cutoff linear variants, and the custom zevian/nom compression
- **Complete model persistence** — every component (cells, forests, networks, multi-lobe Brains) can be fully serialized to/from JSON, copied, saved, and restored
- Powerful per-component **plasticity & stability toolkit** available on every level:

  - `.forget(force)` — continuous forgetting factor (0.0 = full momentum reset, 1.0 = no change, 0.3 = strong gradual decay, etc.)
  - `.rmtolerance(sensitivity)` — intelligent snapping of near-integer values to exact integers (helps escape floating-point drift)
  - `.quantization(sensitivity)` — aggressive, tunable value discretization for long-term numerical robustness
- New **multi-lobe Brain** architecture — allows creating modular, biologically-inspired systems with:
  - Multiple specialized lobes (sensory, abstract, decision, etc.)
  - Independent trainrate & learnrate scaling per lobe
  - Differential plasticity profiles across the hierarchy
- Optional **naturalderiv** mode — makes learning rate scale dynamically with |error| for stronger, more adaptive updates on large mistakes
- Consistent propagation of new control parameters (`learnrate`, `naturalderiv`, `force`) through all layers of the system — from single cells to complete Brains

**New in ZevihaNut/3.0**

* **Hierarchical Multi-Lobe Brain Architecture**  
  Introduction of the powerful new `Brain` class — a true hierarchical composition of multiple `CellNetwork`s (now called "lobes") with unified backpropagation across the entire structure, enabling deep modular designs with biologically-inspired specialization.
* **Differential Plasticity & Modular Control**  
  Per-lobe plasticity tuning via `lobesset` — each lobe can have its own independent `trainrate` and `learnrate` multipliers, allowing fast-adapting sensory lobes, slow & stable conceptual lobes, and ultra-conservative output/decision lobes within the same model.
* **Continuous & Tunable Forgetting Mechanism**  
  Major upgrade: `.forget(force)` now accepts a continuous factor (0.0 = complete momentum reset, 1.0 = no change, 0.3 = strong gradual decay, etc.) — giving unprecedented fine-grained meta-plasticity control at every level of the hierarchy.
* **Natural Error-Proportional Updates**  
  Brand-new `naturalderiv` mode: when enabled, the effective learning rate scales dynamically with |error| → extremely strong adaptation to large mistakes, more biologically plausible gradient behavior, and better handling of sparse/outlier events.
* **Propagated Fine-Grained Learning Control**  
  New `learnrate` parameter flows consistently through the entire system — from individual cells → forests → networks → full multi-lobe Brains — allowing precise adjustment of update magnitudes at any depth.
* **Enhanced Long-Term Stability & Robustness**  
  All previous stabilization tools (`.rmtolerance`, `.quantization`, `.forget`) are now even more powerful and uniformly applied across the deeper, more complex hierarchical structures — making extremely long-running incremental learning sessions dramatically more reliable.
* **Improved Locality & Expert Synergy**  
  Retained and refined center-aware localization, anchor-dominant blending, top-k selection, and `squeezeforclust` routing — now operating seamlessly within the new multi-lobe hierarchy for even sharper specialization at multiple scales.
* **Additional settings**  
  Weight and bias settings for each model.

> [!TIP]  
> **ZevihaNut/3.0 – Towards the Most Realistic Artificial Brain**  
> 
> The new `Brain` class is the most significant milestone yet:  
> it is a **hierarchical, chained structure composed of specially tuned CellNetworks** (now called "lobes").  
> Each lobe can be independently configured for depth, width, activation behavior, learning dynamics and plasticity profile — allowing the creation of modular, biologically-plausible brain-like hierarchies.
> 
> **Core mission reminder**  
> Zevihanthosa was never designed for conventional industrial-scale machine learning.  
> Its ultimate goal is to build **the most realistic possible artificial brain** — an extremely specialized, incremental, hybrid (parametric + non-parametric) system that mimics biological neural organization as closely as current minimalistic tools allow.
> 
> **Important reality about Brain usage**  
> When used carefully — with thoughtful lobe arrangement, precise plasticity settings (`lobesset`), naturalderiv mode, and continuous forgetting — `Brain` can produce strikingly realistic, deeply non-linear, context-sensitive behavior.  
> However, if misused (wrong lobe ordering, mismatched plasticity profiles, over-aggressive learning, or treating it like a standard feed-forward net), it tends to **regress toward linear-like behavior** — losing the very non-linearity and specialization that make it special.
> 
> In other words:  
> A well-tuned Brain can feel disturbingly "alive" and adaptive.  
> A poorly tuned Brain quickly becomes just another (very expensive) linear regressor.
> 
> **Resolved limitations from previous versions**  
> All major bottlenecks from 2.9 have been addressed and extended to support the new hierarchical reality:
> - Scalability: forest_depth + multi-lobe design allows very deep yet manageable architectures  
> - Performance: enhanced squeezeforclust routing + top-k + anchor dominance = fast & precise expert selection even at brain scale  
> - Tuning simplicity: intuitive per-lobe plasticity control (`lobesset`) replaces many previous magic numbers  
> - High-dimensional robustness: improved clustering and compression tools handle complex, multi-feature inputs natively  
> 
> Thank you for following Zevihanthosa's journey.  
> Version 3.0 is not just an incremental update — it is the first serious step toward something that might one day resemble a true artificial mind.  
> But as always: with great realism comes great responsibility in how you tune and use it. 🧠

Thank you for following Zevihanthosa development — 3.0 represents a bold step toward expert specialization.

## Why Zevihanthosa?

* **True Hybrid Artificial Brain Intelligence**  
  Neural momentum cells + pure linear & multiplicative units + non-parametric memory + safe symbolic regression + extreme localized expert ensembles + full deep backprop networks + hierarchical multi-lobe Brains — all fused into one radically minimalist, fully incremental system.

* **Maximum Transparency, Complete Persistence & Deep Interpretability**  
  Every element — single neuron, forest, network or entire Brain — fully serializable to clean, readable JSON; symbolic expressions stay human-readable forever; the whole model can be inspected, edited or restored at any time.

* **Ultra Lightweight & Truly Portable**  
  Pure Python with only built-in modules — no external libraries, no binaries, no GPU. Runs anywhere Python exists, perfect for embedded systems, long-term experiments and offline research.

* **Designed for Education, Biological Plausibility Research, Extreme Specialization & Artificial Brain Experiments**  
  The ideal playground to explore how extreme locality, differential lobe plasticity, continuous forgetting, natural error-driven learning and hierarchical organization can produce surprisingly realistic, brain-like behavior.

* **Extremely Modular & Extensible**  
  Tiny, self-contained cells can be freely combined, ensembled, stacked into networks, grouped into forests or hierarchically composed into Brains. Adding new cell types, activations or plasticity rules is straightforward while preserving the core philosophy.
