What is Zevihanthosa?

Zevihanthosa is an advanced artificial intelligence system developed by aertsimon90. It is designed to push the boundaries of machine learning by creating a flexible, adaptive, and highly efficient AI architecture. The core feature of Zevihanthosa is its dynamic, weight-based learning process, enhanced by a momentum-driven training mechanism, which improves learning speed and accuracy. The model also integrates customizable activation functions and multiple decision-making strategies, providing flexibility for various tasks.

The Zevihanthosa framework supports both single-layer and multi-layer architectures, allowing it to be tailored to a wide range of applications. With a strong focus on scalability, this AI system is designed to evolve and improve continuously through updates, enhancing its performance for diverse use cases.

Current Models and Versions

Latest Release: ZevihaNut/1.3

ZevihaNut/1.3 is the latest iteration of the Zevihanthosa AI framework, introducing key enhancements:

New Activation Function: A new bisigmoid activation function has been introduced, which outputs values between -1 and 1, offering better scalability and adaptability in decision-making.

Advanced Neural Processing System: A refined "Brain" module with enhanced weight distribution, dynamic memory, and improved backpropagation, allowing for faster and more accurate learning.

Hybrid Vectorization: A combination of grammar-based learning, hash-based vectorization, and adaptive tokenization, including new methods for more efficient language understanding and context processing.

Momentum-Based Training: Optimized training that balances learning speed and stability, further improved with momentum-based mechanisms for smoother learning progression.

Multi-Layer Support: The AdvancedChatbot class allows for deeper learning with automatic layer structuring, ensuring that ZevihaNut/1.3 can handle more complex tasks and make decisions more efficiently.

Improved Tokenization: The introduction of new tokenizer methods for splitting text in ways that mirror natural human reading patterns, such as sentence-based, basic word-based, and directive-based methods, ensuring optimal text parsing.

Flexible Decision-Making: Multiple response generation strategies, including probabilistic and similarity-based methods, enabling more accurate and context-aware responses.
