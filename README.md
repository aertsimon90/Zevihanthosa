## What is Zevianthosa?

Zevianthosa is an advanced artificial intelligence system developed by aertsimon90. The model aims to push the boundaries of machine learning by creating a flexible, adaptable, and efficient AI architecture. The core feature of Zevianthosa is its dynamic, weight-based learning process, enhanced by a momentum-based training mechanism that allows for improved learning speed and accuracy. The model also integrates customizable activation functions and offers multiple decision-making strategies for greater task flexibility.

The Zevianthosa framework supports both single-layer and multi-layer configurations and can be adapted to solve a wide variety of tasks. With a focus on scalability, this AI system is designed to evolve and adapt through continuous updates, enhancing its performance for a wide range of use cases.

## Current Models and Versions

The current model is **ZevihaNut/1.0**, the first official release of Zevianthosa. It serves as the foundational version of the Zevianthosa AI framework, offering core features such as dynamic weight adjustments, momentum-based training, custom activation functions, and flexible decision-making methods.

### Upcoming Versions

Zevianthosa is actively being developed, with future versions focused on introducing faster training algorithms, more sophisticated decision-making capabilities, and expanded adaptability to more complex data structures. These updates will enhance the AI's overall functionality, allowing it to tackle a broader range of tasks.

## Is Zevianthosa Open Source?

Yes! Zevianthosa is completely open-source, allowing developers to contribute, modify, and integrate the AI system into their own projects. The goal is to foster collaboration and make Zevianthosa accessible to anyone interested in artificial intelligence development.
